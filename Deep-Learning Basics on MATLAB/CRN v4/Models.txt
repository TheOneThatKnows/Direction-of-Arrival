Version 1 
Input is the estimated covariance matrix
Output is the column vector of the covariance matrix of ULA
We apply MUSIC

Version 2 
Input is the estimated covariance matrix
Output is the column vector of the covariance matrix of ULA
We apply MUSIC

Version 2.1 
Input is the output of Version 2 network
Output is the spectrum where peaks correspond to doa angles

Version 2.2 
Union of Version 2 and Version 2.1
Input is the estimated covariance matrix
Output is the spectrum where peaks correspond to doa angles

Version 2.3 
Gridless version of Version 2.2

Version 2.4 
Similar to Version 2.2
There are 3 inputs: 
- Real part of the estimated covariance matrix
- Imaginary part of the estimated covariance matrix
- The estimated covariance matrix itself

Version 2.5 
Similar to Version 2.2
There are 3 inputs: 
- Real part of the estimated covariance matrix 
- Imaginary part of the estimated covariance matrix 
- Phase of the estimated covariance matrix 

Version 2.6 
Similar to Version 1 and Version 2.5
There is 1 input which has three dimensions: 
- Real part of the estimated covariance matrix 
- Imaginary part of the estimated covariance matrix 
- Phase of the estimated covariance matrix 

Version 2.7 
Similar to Version 2.2
- Instead of 1D convolution layers, MLP is used
